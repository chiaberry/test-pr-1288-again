# Mobility Project Database

#### How might we support comprehensive tracking of Austin’s mobility activities? 
 
The City of Austin Transportation Department has a diverse portfolio of mobility-related infrastructure projects. These are currently managed in various platforms — from simple spreadsheets administered by a single workgroup to bespoke enterprise software that tracks all capitally-funded projects. As a result, there is no centralized system of record, analysis and reporting capabilities are limited, and resources are not used efficiently. 

Using a single platform to manage all of ATD’s mobility-related infrastructure projects would increase organizational alignment, enable holistic analysis and reporting, and lay the groundwork for robust business intelligence and data integrations.
