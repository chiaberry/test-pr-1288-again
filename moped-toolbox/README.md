# TOOLBOX

This is a collection of scripts which have been written to serve a one-time or infrequent purpose. They are not intended to be run in an automated fashion and commonly would be used from the command line when needed. They will each have different parameters and possible environment variables which need to be set for the script to function as intended.

## backfill_data_tracker_url_field

The Moped application supports keeping correlated records in ATD's Knack Data Tracker instance. This script can be used to populate the label field for all synchronized records.
